                Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I
                embarked on a journey fueled by insatiable curiosity and
                unwavering determination. My academic pursuits culminated in a
                groundbreaking thesis titled 'Video-Based Traffic Density
                Calculator with Traffic Light Control Simulation,' a project
                that garnered global acclaim at CCSE-ASEAN 2019 and ICONTAS '23.

                <br />
                While technology has been a driving force in my life, there's
                more to me than just code. I find solace and a sense of freedom
                on the basketball court, where every dribble becomes a metaphor
                for life's challenges and triumphs. Off the court, the
                enchanting melodies of music offer a soothing escape, enriching
                the tapestry of my existence. Additionally, I have a deep
                affection for my two loyal canine companions. I love playing
                with my dogs, taking them on leisurely walks, and savoring
                moments of pure connection with these furry friends.
                <br />
                <br />
                And as a passionate traveler, I have an insatiable appetite for
                exploring new places, experiencing diverse cultures, and seeking
                inspiration from the wonders of the world. My life is a fusion
                of innovation, competition, artistic expression, and the thrill
                of discovering new horizons, both in the tech world and in the
                realm of human experience.
