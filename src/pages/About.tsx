                bridge-builder, adept at forming seamless connections with
                diverse teams, whether it's coordinating harmoniously with
                backend developers to ensure the flawless functionality of web
                applications or collaborating closely with UI designers to bring
                artistic visions to life. This collaborative spirit fuels a
                constant flow of innovative ideas, fostering an environment
                where collective creativity flourishes and projects are driven

                Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I
                embarked on a journey fueled by insatiable curiosity and
                unwavering determination. My academic pursuits culminated in a
                groundbreaking thesis titled 'Video-Based Traffic Density
                Calculator with Traffic Light Control Simulation,' a project
                that garnered global acclaim at CCSE-ASEAN 2019 and ICONTAS '23.

                <br />
                While technology has been a driving force in my life, there's
                more to me than just code. I find solace and a sense of freedom
                on the basketball court, where every dribble becomes a metaphor
                for life's challenges and triumphs. Off the court, the
                enchanting melodies of music offer a soothing escape, enriching
                the tapestry of my existence. Additionally, I have a deep
                affection for my two loyal canine companions. I love playing
                with my dogs, taking them on leisurely walks, and savoring
                moments of pure connection with these furry friends.
                <br />
                <br />
                And as a passionate traveler, I have an insatiable appetite for
                exploring new places, experiencing diverse cultures, and seeking
                inspiration from the wonders of the world. My life is a fusion
                of innovation, competition, artistic expression, and the thrill
                of discovering new horizons, both in the tech world and in the
                realm of human experience.
