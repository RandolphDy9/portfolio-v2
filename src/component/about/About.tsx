                  Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I
                  embarked on a path fueled by curiosity and determination. A
                  crowning achievement was our groundbreaking thesis, "Video-Based
                  Traffic Density Calculator with Traffic Light Control
                  Simulation," which garnered recognition from across the globe.
                  Our work shone on the international stage at the International
                  Conference on Climate Change and Sustainability Engineering in
                  ASEAN (CCSE-ASEAN) 2019, as well as the prestigious
                  International Conference on New Trends in Applied Sciences

                  Beyond the digital realm, I find solace on the basketball court,
                  where the game becomes my ultimate stress reliever and a
                  sanctuary of tranquility. Alongside Kobe, my endearing
                  3-year-old Shih Tzu, life's simple pleasures are magnified, each
                  tail wag a reminder of pure joy. Music, my unwavering companion,
                  weaves its enchanting melodies into my focus and emotions. As
                  life orchestrates its intricate symphony of experiences, I'm
